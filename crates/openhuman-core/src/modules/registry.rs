//! The set of modules this build knows how to load.
//!
//! # Why a compiled-in table
//!
//! A loaded module is trusted native code in this process: it shares the address
//! space, the privileges and the crash domain, and tinybus never unloads it.
//! Which modules may be loaded, and which bytes count as legitimate, are
//! therefore build-time decisions rather than runtime discovery. There is no
//! "module marketplace" here on purpose — a registry a server could add entries
//! to would be a remote-code-execution surface with a download step.
//!
//! # The digests are a second gate, not the only one
//!
//! tinybus fetches the release's own `checksum.toml`, compares it with the digest
//! the host supplies, hashes the downloaded archive, and only then extracts and
//! loads. The digests below are the host's half of that agreement. Pinning them
//! in the source is what makes the check auditable offline: a reviewer can read
//! this file against the release page, and a release re-cut under the same tag
//! stops matching rather than silently replacing what runs in-process.
//!
//! # Adding an entry
//!
//! Take the values verbatim from the release's `checksum.toml`. Do not compute
//! them from a local build — the point is to pin what the release publishes, and
//! a locally recomputed digest would agree with itself no matter what was served.
//!
//! # Module layout
//!
//! Records are grouped into one file per module family rather than by line
//! count — see `registry/records_*.rs`. This file only wires them into
//! [`ALL`] and answers [`find`].
