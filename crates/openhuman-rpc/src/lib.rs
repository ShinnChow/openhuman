//! Shared types for JSON-RPC / CLI controller surfaces.
//!
//! This module provides the foundational types and utilities for handling
//! RPC outcomes across different domain modules. It ensures a consistent
//! response format for both internal consumption and external presentation.
//!
//! Domain `rpc` modules should use [`RpcOutcome`] to wrap their results,
//! which facilitates consistent logging and error handling.

///
///  * the registry path — every `RpcOutcome::into_cli_compatible_json` call
///    (152 call sites across the domains), and
///  * the dynamic-dispatch path — `core::types::invocation_to_rpc_json`, used
///    by `core::dispatch` for internal / legacy methods.
///
/// # The rule, and the defect it currently encodes (#6080)
///
/// ```text
/// logs.is_empty()  ->  value                            (bare)
/// otherwise        ->  { "result": value, "logs": … }   (wrapped)
/// ```
///
/// So a controller's **wire shape is decided by its log vector, not by its
/// schema**. Two methods in one namespace can answer differently, and a handler
/// that later gains a log line silently changes its own response shape with no
/// schema change — which is #6080. That defect is deliberately **preserved
/// byte-for-byte here**: normalising it is a wire change across every
/// controller and needs a maintainer's ruling, not a quiet fix inside a
/// refactor.
///
/// What this function buys today is that the rule exists **once**. Before it,
/// the same six lines were written independently in `rpc::RpcOutcome` and in
/// `core::types::invocation_to_rpc_json`; a fix applied to one would have left
/// the other on the old behaviour, and nothing linked them. When the ruling
/// lands, this is the only body that has to change.
